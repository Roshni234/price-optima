# üöó PriceOptima ‚Äî AI-Powered Dynamic Pricing System

RideOptima is an intelligent **dynamic pricing platform** built for ride-hailing services.  
It leverages **machine learning** to recommend optimal ride prices in real time ‚Äî balancing profitability, fairness, and customer satisfaction.

## üß© Problem Statement

Ride-hailing platforms often struggle to set **optimal prices** dynamically due to fluctuating demand, driver availability, and competition.  
Without adaptive pricing:

- **Underpricing** ‚Üí Loss of potential revenue  
- **Overpricing** ‚Üí Increased cancellations  
- **Delayed response** ‚Üí Reduced competitiveness  

## üí° Proposed Solution

RideOptima automatically adjusts fares using ML insights to achieve **fair, data-driven pricing**.

### Key Features
1. **Test Single Record (Personalized Recommendation)**  
   - Users can input ride details manually.  
   - The system predicts the completion probability and recommends the optimal price instantly.

2. **Upload Batch CSV (Bulk Prediction & KPI Dashboard)**  
   - Upload a CSV file with multiple ride records.  
   - The backend performs batch predictions and computes key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:
     - Revenue (baseline vs scenario)
     - Gross Margin
     - Cancellation Rate
     - Price Change Rate  
   - Interactive charts built with **Recharts** visualize the pricing outcomes.
